Project Summary: The team is studying organic carbon persistence with a focus on understanding how smectite clay mineralogy influences carbon storage. Their research examines differences between smectite clays with high organic carbon content and other soil types, including acidic vertisols and kaolinite-dominated soils. They're interested in how specific mineral properties lead to carbon persistence and how this knowledge might scale to broader areas using available databases.
